What to read (in order)

Recontextualizing your previous reading on priors.

1. How the Shape of a Weakly Informative Prior Affects Inferences by Michael Betancourt. Available from https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/weakly_informative_shapes.html

Readings for next week:

* Chapter 5: Hierarchical Models
* Chapter 6: Model checking
* Visualization in Bayesian Workflow by Gabry et al. Available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01449

    This paper is a look at how a good selection of pictures can help you build up Bayesian models. Pay particular attention to Section 5.

* Towards a Principled Bayesian Workflow by Michael Betancourt. Available at: https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/principled_bayesian_workflow.html

    This case study extends the thoughts in the previous paper but does not contain the same information about posterior predictive checks.
